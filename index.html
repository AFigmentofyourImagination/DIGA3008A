      <p>
        Have a look around. There is not much yet and it's a little messy, but I'm
        learning and isn't that the most important part?

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Elri, some may also know me as Sirius. I am a student at Wits,
        and this website is for my course, Interactive Media. Currently it is my
        favourite subject. I did everything with Visual Studio and GitHub. Some of
        my favourite things are pizza (not original of me), disregarding the canon
        of the DCU to create my own happy blobs, and creating art for myself. I
        like to read and write in my spare time, and I have a small black and
        white dog named James, he's turning 5 in September. I also have a younger
        brother that I love dearly, but I will not lend him anything I own. My
        favourite musical artist is Taylor Swift.
