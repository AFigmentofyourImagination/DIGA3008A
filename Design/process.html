          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            Week 1: Added the base of the website, aka the homepage and blog
            page.
          </p>
          <p>Week 2: Added the content of the first two blogs.</p>
          <p>
            Week 3: Hyperfixated on the subject and reorganized the entire file
            structure. Added third blog. First wireframes were made.
          </p>
          <p>Week 4: Added 4th blog. Redid the wireframes.</p>
          <p>
            Week 5: Made the style guide. Fixed some problems with the links.
            Made the whole thing usable through GitHub, because it was being
            difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            Week 6: Introducing CSS to all pages and editing most of the html on
            all pages for this to work. Crying, because somehow only the blog
            section's css works perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Week ???: Having thoughts on redesigning the portfolio page because
            I don't think I have enough to fill everything I had planned. I am
            also fighting with my icons because the internet doesn't understand
            what I mean when I type it into the search bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I had a solution to give the images ids and call it a day when
            I realized I had preemptively solved this problem weeks ago by
            giving images a class... and I promptly forgot about it until today
            when I was ready to break down. (Please hear the exasperation that I
            have of myself.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I still have issues regarding the burger menu, in that it does
            not want to work!?! I have decided to leave it out for my third
            submission, because I have thought and tried, but if this isn't
            something fixable by Sunday, I might just give in. Also, I shrunk
            the portfolio page to what it is currently. (17/05/25)

          <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
          <h3>Interaction flowchart</h3>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="../Images/flowchart.jpg"
            alt="A flowchart showing how interactions will flow."
          />
          <h3>User flow</h3>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="../Images/user-flow.jpg"
            alt="A mind map of how the screens will look in a user flow."
          />
          <h3>Colour Palette:</h3>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="../Images/colour-palette.jpg"
            alt="An image showing all the colours in the colour palette with their names, hexcodes, CMYK, and RGB."
          />
          <h3>Font choice:</h3>
          <p>Headings: Bradley Hand ITC Body: Baskerville</p>
          <h3>Icon style:</h3>
          <p>
            Outlined so that it stands out against the colourfule background.
            Maybe pixelated to fit with the retro theme.
          </p>
          <h3>Do's:</h3>
          <p>
            Keep the navigation bar in a hamburger menu. Keep the footers at the
            bottom. Align the images as a collage.
          </p>
          <h3>Don'ts:</h3>
          <p>Forget to reference. Stop believing.</p>
          <h3>Buttons:</h3>
          <p>Will swell when mouse hovers over it and lighten when clicked.</p>
          <h3>Quick questions to ponder later when I have more info:</h3>
          <p>
            Do I make my images a download button? If I do that then I'll need
            to add a watermark to the images, but what? A logo?
