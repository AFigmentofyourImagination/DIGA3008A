        <h1>Design</h1>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        Week 1: Added the base of the website, aka the homepage and blog page.
        <br />
        Week 2: Added the content of the first two blogs.
        <br />
        Week 3: Hyperfixated on the subject and reorganized the entire file
        structure. Added third blog. First wireframes were made.
        <br />
        Week 4: Added 4th blog. Redid the wireframes.
        <br />
        Week 5: Made the style guide. Fixed some problems with the links. Made
        the whole thing usable through GitHub, because it was being difficult.
        <br />
        Week 6: Introducing CSS to all pages and editing most of the html on all pages for this to work. Crying, because somehow only the blog section's css works perfectly.
        <br />
        <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Interaction flowchart</h3>        
        <img src="../Images/flowchart.jpg" alt="A flowchart showing how interactions will flow.">
        <br/>
        <h3>User flow</h3>        
        <img
          src="../Images/user-flow.jpg"
          alt="A mind map of how the screens will look in a user flow."
        />
        <br />
        <h3>Colour Palette:</h3>        
        <img src="../Images/colour-palette.jpg" alt="An image showing all the colours in the colour palette with their names, hexcodes, CMYK, and RGB.">
        <br/>
        <h3>Font choice:</h3> 
        Headings: Bradley Hand ITC
        <br/>
        Body: Baskerville
        <br/>
        <h3>Icon style:</h3> Outlined so that it stands out against the colourfule background. Maybe pixelated to fit with the retro theme.
        <br/>
        <h3>Do's:</h3>        
        Keep the navigation bar in a hamburger menu.
        <br/>
        Keep the footers at the bottom.
        <br/>
        Align the images as a collage.
        <br/>
        <h3>Don'ts:</h3>
        Forget to reference.
        <br/>
        Stop believing.
        <br/>
        <h3>Buttons:</h3>
        Will swell when mouse hovers over it and lighten when clicked.
        <br/>
        <h3>Quick questions to ponder later when I have more info:</h3>
        Do I make my images a download button?
        <br/>
        If I do that then I'll need to add a watermark to the images, but what? A logo?
