        <h2>Process</h2>
        Week 1: Added the base of the website, aka the homepage and blog page.
        <br />
        Week 2: Added the content of the first two blogs.
        <br />
        Week 3: Hyperfixated on the subject and reorganized the entire file
        structure. Added third blog. First wireframes were made.
        <br />
        Week 4: Added 4th blog. Redid the wireframes.
        <br />
        Week 5: Made the style guide. Fixed some problems with the links. Made
        the whole thing usable through GitHub, because it was being difficult.
        <br />
        <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
        <br />
        Interaction flowchart
        <br/>
        <img src="../Images/flowchart.jpg" alt="A flowchart showing how interactions will flow.">
        <br/>
        User flow
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/user-flow.png"
          alt="A mind map of how the screens will look in a user flow."
        />
        <br />
        Primary Colour palette
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/primary-colour-scheme.png"
          alt="4 colours with their hex codes."
        />
        <br />
        Neutral colours
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/neutral-colours.png"
          alt="2 neutral colours with their hex codes."
        />
        <br />
        Tersiary colours
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/tersiary-colours.png"
          alt="2 colours with their hex codes."
        />
        <br/>
        Font choice: 
        Headings: Bradley Hand ITC
        Body: Baskerville
        <br/>
        Icon style: Outlined so that it stands out against the colourfule background. Maybe pixelated.
        <br/>
        Do's:
        <br/>
        Keep the navigation bar in a hamburger menu.
        <br/>
        Keep the footers at the bottom.
        <br/>
        Align the images as a collage.
        <br/>
        Don'ts:
        <br/>
        Forget to reference.
        <br/>
        Stop believing.
        <br/>
        Buttons:
        Will swell when mouse hovers over it and lighten when clicked.
        <br/>
        Quick questions to ponder later:
        <br/>
        Do I make my images a download button?
        <br/>
        If I do that then I'll need to add a watermark to the images, but what? A logo?
