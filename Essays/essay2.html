        <p>
          The case study I have chosen for this essay to analyse is the renaming
          of the Gulf of Mexico on Google Maps for U.S. users in the context of
          the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality. This is so that I
          may understand how these three concepts interact with one another in
          the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          To establish context, on the 20th of January 2025 the Gulf of Mexico
          was to be renamed as the Gulf of America by U.S. federal agencies.
          This executive order was signed by the current U.S. president. On
          Google Maps, the Gulf of Mexico was changed to the Gulf of America for
          only U.S. users whereas for the rest of the world it was still
          referred to as the Gulf of Mexico, although the Gulf of America was
          put in brackets afterwards. This has sparked a lot of controversy and
          even a lawsuit against Google from the Mexican president for the
          rename.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many have speculated this renaming is because it is to establish
          power. This opinion is backed by scholars.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Williamson (2023) wrote, “Exploring the erasure of native place names
          demonstrates how naming or renaming in the process of colonial
          expansion was fundamental to the exertion of control over physical and
          social environments (Grounds, 2001).”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The Gulf of Mexico was named that all the way back in the early
          1540’s, before that it had no name. By renaming it means to rid of all
          the history it has. To rename it means rewriting its history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google had renamed the Gulf of Mexico because it is a company based in
          America and unfortunately the rest of the world, especially us in the
          South, is reliant on their information.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Almost all mediums of information (e.g. book publishing, newspaper
          publications, and patents) in the early twenty-first century are still
          characterized by huge geographic inequalities: with the Global North
          producing, consuming, and controlling much of the world’s codified
          knowledge, and the Global South largely left out of these processes.”
          (Graham, 2014: 104).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          With the Global North dominant in our access to information, the
          renaming of the Gulf of Mexico can cause the rich history of the
          location to be forgotten in future generations.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “As geography becomes ever more digital, search engines thus
          increasingly mediate not just information but also spatial knowledges
          and experiences.” (Ballatore et al. 2017: 1195).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          History is important so we may know where we came from and how we have
          changed as humans, thus rewriting it is harmful.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Although a variety of Web search services and technologies exist, the
          search market is controlled by a handful of large actors.” (Ballatore
          et al. 2017: 1196).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This quote reinforces the notion that history is written by the
          conqueror, and in this case, the large actors are Google and the
          companies’ want to be in the U.S. government’s good graces because the
          U.S. has power.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, Ballatore et al. (2017, 1196) has established that Google is
          the dominant search engine, with 64% of U.S. residents and 88% of U.K.
          residents, and having 54% of the entire world’s search advertising
          market, which is in 188 countries.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “This monopoly has not gone unnoticed and has attracted the attention
          of European antitrust agencies and a variety of critics, worried about
          such a concentration of information, power, and capital (e.g.,
          Vaidhyanathan 2011; Grimmelmann 2013)." (Ballatore et al. 2017: 1196).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is not the first case where Google
          has tried to remain politically correct while sparking controversy. In
          2012, Google had used the same locale-based naming to another place
          who were having disputes over the naming of said place. This place is
          the Persian Gulf. Google Maps had left the waterway between the
          Arabian peninsula and Iran nameless until Iran had threatened legal
          action against Google. Now the place reads “Persian Gulf (Arabian
          Gulf)”. It seems ironic that Google is caught in another renaming
          controversy involving another Gulf.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “We begin with the hypothesis that the Internet had a variety of
          effects across locations because the impact of lower communication,
          transportation, and search costs varies by location, depending on
          three main factors: local preferences, the availability of
          substitutes, and the availability of complements.” (Greenstein, Forman
          and Goldfarb, 2018: 270).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This quote explains that the Internet’s effects reach far even without
          access to said Internet. Google can rename any place it wants to
          whatever it wants because it has power over politically weaker
          countries and people will use Google’s name if they do not know better
          because people are reliant on the information and over time, the name
          of the place is rewritten in the image of Google, history forcibly
          hidden and forgotten.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Emphasising the cultural politics of naming has revealed ‘how people
          seek to control, negotiate, and contest the naming process as they
          engage in wider struggles for legitimacy and visibility’ (Rose-Redwood
          et al., 2010, p. 457).” (Williamson, 2023).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Mexico’s lawsuit against Google for renaming the whole Gulf proves
          that people will fight and struggle for legitimacy and visibility to
          not be erased from the narrative. Mexico has argued that the U.S. had
          only renamed their shelf of the Gulf, not the whole thing, so Google
          should fix it to be factually correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          By renaming and reshaping the history of a place, Google is actively
          colonising the Gulf of Mexico for the U.S. government.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The Cambridge dictionary defines colonization as “the act or process
          of filling a place or taking control of an area of activity.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Renaming it to the Gulf of America, ownership moves to the U.S. and
          thus so does the history, and the history will be rewritten to show
          how America was never in the wrong when in fact they were. The truth
          of colonization will be buried along with the name Gulf of Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings me to my conclusion that by something as simple as
          renaming a place can cause an entire history to disappear and spark
          controversy of colonization. It also shows that not only will the
          history be threatened, but the culture will suffer as well, it will
          fight for legitimacy. History in any sense of the word is always
          rewritten by the winners, and the winners are usually the ones with
          power. Google has an abundance of power and is choosing to sit in the
          lap of the U.S. government.
