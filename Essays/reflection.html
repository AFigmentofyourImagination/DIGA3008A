          My website’s folder structure does reflect the hierarchy of the
          information structure of my content. This is to say that the 5
          categories are reflected in order as they are on the navigation menu
          within the folder structure, except the home page, because that is how
          my computer had chosen to list them, and I do not know how to change
          it, nor do I mind. The content within the folders reflects what is
          available on said pages, so it makes sense in that regard. I have also
          put all the CSS files in one folder and all the JavaScript files in
          another if they were needed. The naming conventions makes sense to me
          in the sense that it was easier for me to find the correct information
          when I added the content to the pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe my semantic markup is sufficient to provide the correct
          amount of context to the browsers. I even asked around the class for
          any constructive criticism and took in all their feedback. The
          interface elements seem to me to have the correct signals to the user,
          such as the back to top arrows and the previous and next buttons that
          appears when the user opens the content in the four content heavy
          pages. I have also indicated which page someone is on in the
          navigation bar using a different colour background and coloured icon.
          I feel like the content is expressed in a comprehensive and correct
          manner. The semantic markup allows a screen reader to know what they
          are reading and allows for the browser to accurately categorize the
          content of the pages. As I understand it, the correct usage of
          semantic markup is used to improve blind people to access the website
          and interact with it when they use a screen reader. It also allows for
          the person to easier navigate the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe the metadata is sufficient to guide the browser in
          interpreting the content correctly. I have collected data from
          multiple different devices from family to see if the website works
          correctly and have received thumbs up on their end. The content that
          required the metadata included the font style and the screen sizing
          and how things need to change in the event it was accessed by
          different devices with different screen sizes. In the metadata is also
          where the CSS have been linked and the tab display name. I feel like
          the metadata has been expressed fully and correctly in my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have kept the CSS styling to only separate CSS files and out of the
          HTML files. This had been an easier task later on after I started
          learning CSS as before that I was kind of stressed about the size of
          the images. To me it is maintainable, and it seems modular, which
          means it follows a checklist of things, so I knew I didn’t leave
          anything out. My opinion might be skewed regarding this point, though.
          As stated earlier, I have used CSS to add responsive layouts that
          adapt to different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did successfully use JavaScript to add important elements that I
          could not do using CSS. I feel like I could have used more JavaScript,
          but I did not know what to add further that was necessary. I tried my
          best to avoid any repeated interaction points and functionalities and
          I believe I succeeded. My website does consistently refer to the
          JavaScript file attached. Another reason I tried to use less
          JavaScript is because I know it reduces loading speed, and I did not
          want my user to be waiting longer than they need to in order to load a
          page. During this project, I felt the least comfortable in my skill in
          JavaScript. I do feel like it is my area of weakness, and that is why
          I will spend my free time practising JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project had taught me a lot, so my goal was realized: I learned
          through my failures, and I learned another skill that is important to
          me.
