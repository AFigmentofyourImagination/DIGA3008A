          In this essay, I will be analysing the website of the radio station
          Hot 102.7, a South African website, to inspect the applications of UX
          and UI design. I chose this website because my dad and I listen to
          this radio station together while driving. This is so that I may learn
          what I may need to keep in mind when creating my own websites in the
          future of what is important, to know what to avoid, and what to
          implement. This essay will focus on the website’s ethics, its design
          choices, and its principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website of Hot 102.7 is a website for an accomplished radio
          station in South Africa. The radio station is for entertainment and
          news purposes, the news being of important happenings in the world, in
          our own country, and in their own radio station. They frequently host
          and offer charity donations which they have called Hot Cares. The
          radio station has their main show, the one available on any radio in
          their broadcasting area that plays old school and R&B music, and then
          they have their own sub-stations consisting of different music genres.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “The most significant consideration when designing user experiences is
          usability, which refers to how efficiently and satisfactorily a user
          can accomplish a specific goal, using a particular feature, design
          solution, or product.” (Ghanchi, 2021)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          First, I will be looking at the usability of this website with this
          quote in mind. For the average person, that is someone who on average
          uses the internet 6 hours per day or more, the website is simple and
          easy to understand. The icons are large enough to use without the user
          accidentally clicking on something they did not wish to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do however fear that for someone who does not use the internet that
          much, or is not that internet savvy, that it would be more difficult
          to navigate. This is because while it is easily manoeuvrable, the
          navigation bar does not light up or have an animation effect if it is
          hovered over with the cursor, even though it shows the user what page
          they are currently on. Nor does all the clickable things indicate that
          they are interactable other than the mouse cursor shape turning from
          the standard arrow to a little pointy hand. This is indicative of poor
          design and leads to less sustainability of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          While on the subject of the links and the navigation, the live show of
          the main station is off to the side and smaller than the rest of the
          things on the website, even though it stays on the screen as you
          scroll. The problem with this is that the user might ignore it,
          thinking it is just a popup because people simply do not read labels
          in this day and age. The website posts snippets of a full show to
          their podcast page, which is helpful to users who want to relisten to
          a particular section. The problem with this is that it is then made a
          bit more difficult for the average consumer to find the entire
          broadcast. This could then lead to the user just giving up and losing
          interest in the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the window is resized on desktop, the images on the homepage
          resize too, this is a given and even expected. The issue arises when
          the images become large enough that it distorts or become more
          pixelated because these images then also take up the entire width of
          the window.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Errors of functioning are due to some mechanical or electrical fault
          which causes the machine to behave otherwise than it was designed to
          do.” (Turing, 1950).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Because of this, it does make this website less sustainable on mobile
          or a device with a smaller screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I will be looking at the privacy and transparency the website
          offers the user, and I will also keep the following quote by Ghanchi
          (2021) in mind,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “The advantages of using this data include our ability to shape and
          improve the user experience. Still, we should know where to stop and
          how much access to users’ data is actually necessary.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The only times the website asks you for your information is if you
          want to make a donation or if you want to sign up for the newsletter.
          The content is not hidden behind a paywall or signing up for it. This
          allows users to casually scroll through without giving their personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website of Hot 102.7 is quite transparent in regards to who they
          hire for their cast and what they do on their shows in their ‘about’
          section. They also have an entire section dedicated to news, which
          shows what they deem important to attach their names to. This creates
          a sense of trust that the user can see whether or not they want to
          associate with them or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the accessibility and inclusivity of the website, the following
          will be a main idea to keep in mind:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Inclusive and accessible design is not about designing for the
          majority and then adapting for the minority. It’s about acknowledging
          diversity from the get-go and ensuring that everyone can have an
          equally rewarding experience.” (Mok, 2023)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          As I have mentioned in the second paragraph, Hot 102.7 has 4
          sub-stations. These are called Hot Rock, Hot Easy, Hot Club, and Hot
          Treffers. These are only accessible through the website or their app.
          These sub-stations are live, so if the user chooses to listen to
          those, they would need quite the amount of data or access to Wi-Fi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information you get when you surf through the website are all neat
          and organized, which is good because if the user is searching for a
          specific thing, it is easier to find it. And it also allows for the
          user to find other things relevant to what they are interested in.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “One of the main advantaged of the Internet is the access it provides
          to organised information.” (Daniolou, 2020)
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          “Links can point to anything that can be displayed, including search
          result lists.” (Berners-Lee et al., 1994)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The website makes use of links for the tickets for the events that you
          might be interested in visiting or attending that they either host or
          sponsor. The way they show how to access these windows are by making
          them brighten from a red background to a yellow one when your mouse
          cursor hovers over it, potentially showing that they do want the user
          to click on them. The reason they chose the red and yellow is because
          the three main colour for the radio station is red, yellow and white.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you do get the information you are looking for when you use the
          search bar, which only has a tiny magnifying glass to indicate there
          even is one, the navigation menu is invisible until you scroll further
          downwards. This is because the main background colour is white! This
          leads to bad design and obviously accessibility issues, especially if
          you usually use dark mode because of eye strain like I do. I
          frequently use the dark mode every time it is an option, so the fact
          that this website of a radio station that I like did not have one
          really did not live up to expectations. This leads to the accidental
          exclusion of people with eye strain. I do not believe this was their
          intent, because they have simply just stuck to their colour scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Events that Hot 102.7 sponsors are shown first and last on the home
          page, which is good practice of the serial position effect. According
          to The Decision Lab (2022), the serial position effect
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “…suggests that we best remember the first and last items in a series
          and find it hard to remember the middle items.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is good practice of ethical persuasion and influence. They have a
          separate page for the charities that the user could donate to if they
          so wish. This is because it is good practice to not force the user to
          pay for the bare minimum features of a website like information.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Persuasion tactics that change users’ perspectives and convince them
          to buy a specific subscription just to increase conversions are highly
          unethical.” (Ghanchi, 2021)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          With all of this, I have come to the conclusion that while the website
          of Hot 102.7 does indeed have a lot to learn, however it does
          accomplish its main goal of sharing more information about the radio
          station. They have good morals in that they do not hide their services
          behind a paywall, and they have transparency to their audience and any
          visitors of the website. It is a good website for those who enjoy
          their service and for those who enjoy those genres of music in South
          Africa. They do have a nice design for the user that just quickly want
          to check something, though their navigation menu does need some
          improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I have learned to consider when designing my own website from
          this is that eye strain is unfortunately a thing so I would need to
          make a dark mode. The navigation menu needs to be visible on all
          pages, not just the homepage, so it needs to stand out from the rest
          of the website while also not looking out of place. Image resizing on
          different devices is important for website sustainability and should
          be checked over before committing to it. Websites can exist without
          those annoying popups shoving additional things down your throat and
          still show the information they could have put into popups.
