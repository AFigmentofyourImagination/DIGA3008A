          I chose Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet needs
          African Feminists and Feminisms. I will be explaining quotes from the
          article that I felt was important to the message stated in its title.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "With many gatherings and meetings being cancelled and postponed, the
          quick and easy solution that is being shared around is “well then,
          let’s just meet online”, and therein lies the problem: presenting the
          internet as a solution to a social problem, as some kind of
          communication silver bullet that imagines an equality of access, use
          and representation on the internet which is false. And this is why we
          need even more African feminists and feminisms on, in, around the
          internet, to counter the idea that technology somehow levels the
          playing field for all, and is an infallible solution to all our
          problems."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          People use the internet as a solution to meet with others, which can
          be useful but not everyone has equal access to use the internet so the
          representation of the availability is incorrect. The author's solution
          is that in order to level the playing field for everyone, more African
          feminists need to be involved in and around the internet to go against
          the idea that technology is a one-size-fits-all solution.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "When the All Women Count-Take Back The Tech! (AWC-TBTT!) project at
          the Association for Progressive Communications Women’s Rights
          Programme (APC WRP) decided to host a Making a Feminist Internet in
          Africa and the Diaspora (MFIAfrica) gathering in October 2019, the
          goal was clear. Find and bring together as diverse as possible a group
          of African activists, thinkers, artists and feminists to talk about
          technology, the internet and the power and impact it has on our lives
          and our work. This was not the first gathering of its kind, but it was
          the first such gathering held in Africa, with and for African
          feminists and activists."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The meeting invited a diverse group of people from Africa: activists,
          thinkers, artists, feminists. They were to talk about how technology
          and internet has a power over them and the impact it has on their
          lives and work. This was the first of these gatherings that happened
          in Africa, by Africans for Africans.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Technology has thrust communities of people online and offline into a
          space where the online realities and emerging issues do not have
          offline processes and recourse. Online gender-based violence, for
          example, has been a pressing concern raised by many women, LGBTIQA and
          gender non-conforming people, but legislation that recognises and acts
          on these attacks and violence is largely absent in many African
          countries. Because of this, the online space has become a “safe space”
          for people and communities of people to attack women, LGBTIQA people
          and enbies and mostly get away with it."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Communities had been forced to go online as well as online and this
          has caused some of the communities to not have a system in place for
          when it goes offline. Things like gender-based violence have been
          causing problems before the internet, but with the internet, that hate
          is spread faster and further. The people who can push the law onto the
          cyberbullies in reality are absent in Africa. And because of this, the
          cyberbullies get away with targeting their victims both online and
          offline.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The inequality of access to and representation on the internet is
          fast replicating existing oppression and suppression."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The imbalance of people that have access to the internet and
          representation on the internet to the people without it is quickly
          causing the digital divide to widen and duplicates the current
          oppression and suppression, so the divide alienates those who do not
          have access or representation on the internet.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "In the dark corner of the popular narratives of Africa and its people
          (and problems) you will find shelved the stories of women, queers, and
          people with disabilities."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          History is written by the winners, and all the history of the losers
          are buried into dark corners where it is near impossible to find. In
          this case, the narratives of Africans that you do not hear is also
          buried away. Those stories are by women, queers, and people with
          disabilities.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The internet and technology are a powerful space, I daresay force,
          that African women and LGBTIQA people have always contributed to. Our
          everyday lives extend to online platforms and tools where we plan and
          share and love and grow. The internet has helped shape how we are
          perceived and how too we perceive ourselves. The internet is also a
          site of great violence that is directed at people who express
          themselves in ways and voices that do not conform."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The internet and technology had been shaped by many, INCLUDING African
          women and LGBTQIA+ people. In return, the internet and technology had
          also shaped the way we are seen and how we see ourselves.
          Unfortunately, the internet was also shaped by bullies who do nothing
          but tear us down for who we are.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Without a feminist internet that ensures that all people can access
          and influence content and governance of this internet, we will be
          replicating a violent and oppressive way of life that might eventually
          be inescapable."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Without the feminine, the toxic masculine (I'm not saying all
          masculine, I'm saying the toxic part of it) will keep and take over
          the internet. The few good masculine will be erased if they do not
          have the backing of millions upon millions of femininity.
