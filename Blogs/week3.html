      <p>
        I best explain using pictures, so I made a flowchart of what
        interaction/user experience on my website would look like:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/flowchart.jpg"
          alt="A flowchart indicating how the website will flow."
        />
        <br />
        I also made a new wireframe for the homepage:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Homepage.jpg"
          alt="Wireframe idea with a bright background containing curvy lines with a green information card and an orange hamburger navigation bar."
        />
        <br />
        This one is a bit more streamline and I added a navigation bar so it is
        better to navigate. I made it like a hamburger menu because I just felt
        like that would be easier for both desktop and mobile, and also I
        thought it looked cute. Hopefully this shows my goals for the website
        overall and would show anyone who interacts with the website what I'm
        all about in the sense of my work and personality as they often go
        together, I think. The navigation bar also shows what content is
        available to see upon the very first look. With the hamburger navigation
        bar, it also shows how I prioritized what everyone sees, namely the
        homepage first, then blogs, design, essays, portfolio. It is also
        definitely a coincidence that after the homepage it is alphabetical
        order. (It actually was, I don't know how I did that).
        <br />
        I don't know if I should add a search bar, because I think everything is
        easily found using the navigation bar, so feedback on that would be
        appreciated. I am toying with the idea of dropdown lists for subfolders
        in the design and portfolio links in the navigation bar so it's easier
        to immediately find things or at least see what they offer. Icons and
        pictures aren't added on the wireframes as of yet, because this is
        literally just me throwing ideas around and see what works for me. Since
        my aesthetic for the website is a bit retro, I am thinking of making the
        outline of the navigation bar little cameras or tapes and maybe a border
        around the clickable things.
