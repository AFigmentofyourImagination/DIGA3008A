          I best explain using pictures, so I made a flowchart of what
          interaction/user experience on my website would look like:
        </p>
        <img
          class="image"
          src="../Images/flowchart.jpg"
          alt="A flowchart indicating how the website will flow."
        />
        <p>I also made a new wireframe for the homepage:</p>
        <img
          class="image"
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Homepage.jpg"
          alt="2nd wireframe idea for the homepage."
        />
        <p>
          This one is a bit more streamline and I added a navigation bar so it
          is better to navigate. I made it like a hamburger menu because I just
          felt like that would be easier for both desktop and mobile, and also I
          thought it looked cute. Hopefully this shows my goals for the website
          overall and would show anyone who interacts with the website what I'm
          all about in the sense of my work and personality as they often go
          together, I think. The navigation bar also shows what content is
          available to see upon the very first look. With the hamburger
          navigation bar, it also shows how I prioritized what everyone sees,
          namely the homepage first, then blogs, design, essays, portfolio. It
          is also definitely a coincidence that after the homepage it is
          alphabetical order. (It actually was, I don't know how I did that).
        </p>

          I don't know if I should add a search bar, because I think everything
          is easily found using the navigation bar, so feedback on that would be
          appreciated. I am toying with the idea of dropdown lists for
          subfolders in the design and portfolio links in the navigation bar so
          it's easier to immediately find things or at least see what they
          offer. Icons and pictures aren't added on the wireframes as of yet,
          because this is literally just me throwing ideas around and see what
          works for me. Since my aesthetic for the website is a bit retro, I am
          thinking of making the outline of the navigation bar little cameras or
          tapes and maybe a border around the clickable things.
