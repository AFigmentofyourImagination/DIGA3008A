    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>
      Setting up the GitHub and publishing to Pages was easy enough with the
      guides provided to us. It showed clear step by step instructions on how to
      set everything up. I chose the reading of Harper's "'As we may think' at
      65". (2010) Harper takes a look at Bush's "As we may think". In this, I
      realized that we think in associations and thus we envision the web in a
      certain way, mostly as a library of alphabetized lists and search tags.
      People has individualized browser experiences custom to their preferences,
      like the bookmarks tab at the top of your screen. Bush had also visualized
      a sort of personalized library. "In ‘As We May Think’, Vannevar Bush
      showed us a vision of how information could be manageable even on a large
      scale by association based on the experience of the individual." (Harper,
      2010) Because of this type of personalization, people are often limited to
      their own bubbles of information because they do not know to search for a
      different kind of information, mainly because the internet is so
      widespread that it is difficult to grasp all of the information available.
      "We see now that the Web provides us with massive amounts of information,
      but this information is difficult to get a grasp on." (Harper, 2010)
      Interesting things I have learned of the internet is that people don't
      change. Our methods of communication and media may change, but the content
      of the media we use often stay the same. Something the lecturer said on
      Thursday resonated with me in this regard, that everything that can be
      written has already been written. And yet we still rewrite those same
      words in different ways. The goals I have for this course is to have a
      better understanding of media and how to build my own space in the vast
      eternal void that is this internet so I may look back and see how far I
      have come with understanding how people work and think when they are
      protected by a screen and anonymity. I also want to learn the skills this
      course provides so I may have a bigger arsenal for after I graduate.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>
      When reading Moulthrop (2003), it starts as listing the good things that
      hypertext can do for people navigating the internet. It tells a quick
      history linking back to the origin of the hypertext with Vannevar Bush and
      the Memex in the 1940's, artificial intelligence researchers in the 1960's
      created the first hypertextual narrative to experiment with interactive
      computing. Nelson then coined the term hypertext in the 1970's and had big
      ideas for it, which later on caused Engelbart to partner with him to
      create a hypertext system called FRESS. It didn't catch on until 1987,
      when Microsoft Press published Nelson's underground works. Later, in the
      90's, the hype around hypertext had died down for the next big thing and
      Moulthrop (2003) states that "such changes of fashion seem a regular
      hazard of the postmodern territory." He says that people are waiting for a
      technological revolution, but that we do not know what we are actually
      asking for, and are thus constantly disappointed and move in circles.
      After hypertext comes hyperreality. When this essay was published, virtual
      reality was merely living on the internet, but now in today's age, there
      are VR headsets that allows you to move more into a hyper*reality*.
      Moulthrop (2003) explains it best, "Hyperreality, we are told, is a site
      of collapse or implosion where referential or “grounded” utterance becomes
      indistinguishable from the self-referential and the imaginary." Later on,
      he states that we are at risk of falling into a hopelessly abandoned
      simulation. Other academics, that Moulthrop has used, have all said that
      postmodern modes of communication are capable and will destabilize the
      current social hierarchy. We have already seen that happen, the best
      example I can think of is in school where the more followers you have on
      your socials indicate how popular you are in the social hierarchy of
      school. Everyone directs people to follow them on their other social media
      platforms via the hypertext in their bio. This reconstruction of the
      social hierarchy is what Nelson referred to as populitism - the
      combination of "populism” and “elite. The popular elite will shift the
      attention to accommodate the demands of the moment, and this is where the
      politics comes to stir the pot. We have even seen how it could happen this
      year already when the US government tried to ban TikTok, and the orange in
      charge 'played the hero' when he was all for banning the platform just a
      few years ago, and this all caused havoc on the platform for like 2 weeks
      (I'm not on TikTok a lot, so I don't know how long people milked it).
      "Hypertext does increase the agonistic element in reading." (Moulthrop,
      2003) To me, this reads as people using the hypertext are more concerned
      with prior authority than if they were reading conventional writing.
      Mostly because it does not dispel the vibe of the original intent. It is
      easier to streamline the main ideas of a rabbithole, but it also gives way
      to an easier spread of misinformation. It is said at least twice in the
      reading that hypertext does not replace books, but television as we still
      print lots and lots of books in today's time. However, that is not to say
      that books will remain as forests dwindle, paper costs rise, and
      maintenance for libraires will become too much. Though us book lovers need
      not fear as "The chief technological culprit in Kernan’s “death of
      literature” is not the smart machine but the idiot box." (Moulthrop, 2003)
      Hypertext does return two domains, namely literature and writing space. I
      interpret this return of domains as websites like fanfiction.com and AO3
      where people have spaces on the internet to write their literature and
      share that literature with others for free. When taken to its extreme,
      hypertext becomes paradoxical like I have previously mentioned. Reference:
      Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the
      Laws of Media (1991)’. Wireframe ideas:

      />
      I really like the aesthetic of a retro funky vibe. Most of the wireframes
      look like this one, but I will include them in case anyone is interested.

      Then, for mobile, I wanted to keep the squiggly lines and colour scheme
