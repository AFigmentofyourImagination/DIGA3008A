          Santa Clara University (2018) mentions these as important ethics when
          designing websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy. People are worried about how their personal information is
          used in ways that they are not aware of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Net Neutrality. It's challenging on the internet to know what is
          objective truth and what is subjective lies. It is important (and
          ethical) to show your work and where you get your information so
          others can see that you are neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to the Internet. Not everyone has Wi-Fi, so it is important to
          lower the data load. This means you have to simplify the code so it
          can load without a big data surge.
        </p>
        <p>SSO (2024) claims the following as important ethics:</p>
        <p>
          Acceptance and sensitivity to national and local cultures. There needs
          to be an acceptance of different backgrounds and different cultures,
          beliefs, nations, etc. This includes languages. There should be an
          understanding and awareness between users and developers to create a
          positive and friendly online society.
        </p>
        <p>
          No spamming. They mention that the internet should not be used to
          forward emails from strangers and that it can be bad. The reason for
          this, as I see it, is because there are scams and viruses and trojan
          horses attached to those strange emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fake id. They warn against pretending to be someone else on a digital
          space. This includes people pretending to be insurance companies, or a
          friend. This is commonly known as "catfishing".
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid using bad language on public platforms. This one links back to
          being accepting on the internet. The internet is for everyone's
          opinions, even those you disagree with. What is important is to not
          engage in childish name-calling. From a developer's perspective, this
          translates to not calling the user any rude comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protection of private information. Developers should not cause users
          to feel like they are giving personal information for no good reason.
          This includes asking for information that's not relevant.
