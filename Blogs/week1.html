        Setting up the GitHub and publishing to Pages was easy enough with the
        guides provided to us. It showed clear step by step instructions on how
        to set everything up. I chose the reading of Harper's "'As we may think'
        at 65". (2010) Harper takes a look at Bush's "As we may think". In this,
        I realized that we think in associations and thus we envision the web in
        a certain way, mostly as a library of alphabetized lists and search
        tags. People has individualized browser experiences custom to their
        preferences, like the bookmarks tab at the top of your screen. Bush had
        also visualized a sort of personalized library. "In ‘As We May Think’,
        Vannevar Bush showed us a vision of how information could be manageable
        even on a large scale by association based on the experience of the
        individual." (Harper, 2010) <br />
        Because of this type of personalization, people are often limited to
        their own bubbles of information because they do not know to search for
        a different kind of information, mainly because the internet is so
        widespread that it is difficult to grasp all of the information
        available. "We see now that the Web provides us with massive amounts of
        information, but this information is difficult to get a grasp on."
        (Harper, 2010) Interesting things I have learned of the internet is that
        people don't change. Our methods of communication and media may change,
        but the content of the media we use often stay the same. Something the
        lecturer said on Thursday resonated with me in this regard, that
        everything that can be written has already been written. And yet we
        still rewrite those same words in different ways. The goals I have for
        this course is to have a better understanding of media and how to build
        my own space in the vast eternal void that is this internet so I may
        look back and see how far I have come with understanding how people work
        and think when they are protected by a screen and anonymity. I also want
        to learn the skills this course provides so I may have a bigger arsenal
        for after I graduate.
