          Setting up the GitHub and publishing to Pages was easy enough with the
          guides provided to us. It showed clear step by step instructions on
          how to set everything up. I chose the reading of Harper's "'As we may
          think' at 65". (2010) Harper takes a look at Bush's "As we may think".
          In this, I realized that we think in associations and thus we envision
          the web in a certain way, mostly as a library of alphabetized lists
          and search tags. People has individualized browser experiences custom
          to their preferences, like the bookmarks tab at the top of your
          screen. Bush had also visualized a sort of personalized library.

        <blockquote>
          "In ‘As We May Think’, Vannevar Bush showed us a vision of how
          information could be manageable even on a large scale by association
          based on the experience of the individual." (Harper, 2010)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Because of this type of personalization, people are often limited to
          their own bubbles of information because they do not know to search
          for a different kind of information, mainly because the internet is so
          widespread that it is difficult to grasp all of the information
          available.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "We see now that the Web provides us with massive amounts of
          information, but this information is difficult to get a grasp on."
          (Harper, 2010)
        </blockquote>

          Interesting things I have learned of the internet is that people don't
          change. Our methods of communication and media may change, but the
          content of the media we use often stay the same. Something the
          lecturer said on Thursday resonated with me in this regard, that
          everything that can be written has already been written. And yet we
          still rewrite those same words in different ways. The goals I have for
          this course is to have a better understanding of media and how to
          build my own space in the vast eternal void that is this internet so I
          may look back and see how far I have come with understanding how
          people work and think when they are protected by a screen and
          anonymity. I also want to learn the skills this course provides so I
          may have a bigger arsenal for after I graduate.
