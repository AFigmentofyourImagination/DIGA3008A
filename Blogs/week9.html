          "â€¦the ability of individuals and groups to access and use information
          and communication technologies."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Despite the wide marketing of electronic devices in the last decades,
          digitalisation is not happening equally all over the world, due to
          high prices, the lack of infrastructure or weak digital literacy."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "In Africa only 39.3 % of its inhabitants had Internet access,
          compared to 70.5% of Latin Americans, 87.2 % of Europeans and 94.6 %
          of Americans."

        <p>
          As the world moves business online, the divide between the countries
          are becoming bigger as not all of them has the same access to the
          internet. It has been documented this year (2025) that less than half
          of Africa has Internet access, and that's not even covering how many
          people are digitally literate. This divide is made even larger because
          of inequality in pay, bad pay, bad communication, etc. The above
          quotes literally sum up this article because it shows the main facts
          and how we are affected. It even claims that during 2020, the pandemic
          had shown how many people do not have access to these services.

          The Design Justice Network Principles (Design Justice Network, n.d.)
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <blockquote>
          1. We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as
          well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          2. We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the
          outcomes of the design process.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          3. We prioritize design's impact on the community over the intentions
          of the designer.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          4. We view change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and
          collaborative process, rather than as a point at the end of a process.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          5. We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an
          expert.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          6. We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived
          experience, and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to
          bring to a design process.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          7. We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          8. We work towards sustainable, community-led and -controlled
          outcomes.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          9. We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect us to the
          earth and to each other.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          10. Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already
          working at the community level. We honor and uplift traditional,
          indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.
