          My goal for this website is to show people my skills in the world of
          art in a variety of media. I want to be able to put all my artwork in
          one place so it is easier for me to view and show someone in case they
          are interested, and to update the portfolio as I go. Mostly, I want to
          have a thing to keep my family up to date with my latest artworks
          without the chore of needing to interact with them. My family is veryâ€¦
          interested in my art, to a point where I don't even want to show them
          art purely because it is such a hassle to keep bringing an entire
          library to show my grandma. It will also be nice to have a gallery to
          show my talents in case for job hires and scouts. By showing them what
          I can do, they'll be more inclined to hire me if they see I can do the
          job, have the right motivations (love for the craft), and the drive to
          see things through. The most important on my website would be the
          portfolio section in the future. Currently, for my course, the blogs
          are the main priority. The design section will be important for people
          who are interested in my thought process and how I chose what I did
          and why I chose it.
        </p>
        <p>Struggles:</p>
        <p>
          Because my mind is very visual, I struggle to not immediately put
          everything in the right style at this moment. Other than that, I have
          had no big struggles other than little annoyances.
        </p>
        <p>Proud of:</p>
        <p>
          I love my newer wireframe and I love the vibes I want this website to
          be. To me, showing my personality through the visuals of the website
          is important as it is a part of me. And I am kind of proud that I am
          building this website because it is purely mine, it is not something
          someone else did for me. I am also proud of my organization in the
          folders, because everything is sorted and in one place, I get little
          tingles of joy when I see my organized files instead of one big hybrid
          of things.
        </p>
        <p>Changes:</p>
        <p>
          From the original wireframes vs the latest wireframes, a lot has
          changed, the most notable being the navigation bar. I added a
          hamburger navigation bar to all the sections since I think it looks
          nicer and easier to navigate. I might make them slightly bigger. Also
          I decided to make the blocks in the wireframes containing the content
          to be a little see-through so you can see the cool background too.
