          When reading Moulthrop (2003), it starts as listing the good things that
          hypertext can do for people navigating the internet. It tells a quick
          history linking back to the origin of the hypertext with Vannevar Bush
          and the Memex in the 1940's, artificial intelligence researchers in the
          1960's created the first hypertextual narrative to experiment with
          interactive computing. Nelson then coined the term hypertext in the
          1970's and had big ideas for it, which later on caused Engelbart to
          partner with him to create a hypertext system called FRESS. It didn't
          catch on until 1987, when Microsoft Press published Nelson's underground
          works. Later, in the 90's, the hype around hypertext had died down for
          the next big thing and Moulthrop (2003) states that 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "such changes of fashion seem a regular hazard of the postmodern territory."
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
          He says that
          people are waiting for a technological revolution, but that we do not
          know what we are actually asking for, and are thus constantly
          disappointed and move in circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hypertext comes hyperreality. When this essay was published,
          virtual reality was merely living on the internet, but now in today's
          age, there are VR headsets that allows you to move more into a
          hyper*reality*. Moulthrop (2003) explains it best, 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Hyperreality, we are
          told, is a site of collapse or implosion where referential or “grounded”
          utterance becomes indistinguishable from the self-referential and the
          imaginary."
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
          Later on, he states that we are at risk of falling into a
          hopelessly abandoned simulation. Other academics, that Moulthrop has
          used, have all said that postmodern modes of communication are capable
          and will destabilize the current social hierarchy. We have already seen
          that happen, the best example I can think of is in school where the more
          followers you have on your socials indicate how popular you are in the
          social hierarchy of school. Everyone directs people to follow them on
          their other social media platforms via the hypertext in their bio. This
          reconstruction of the social hierarchy is what Nelson referred to as
          populitism - the combination of "populism” and “elite. The popular elite
          will shift the attention to accommodate the demands of the moment, and
          this is where the politics comes to stir the pot.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have even seen how it could happen this year already when the US
          government tried to ban TikTok, and the orange in charge 'played the
          hero' when he was all for banning the platform just a few years ago, and
          this all caused havoc on the platform for like 2 weeks (I'm not on
          TikTok a lot, so I don't know how long people milked it). 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Hypertext
          does increase the agonistic element in reading." (Moulthrop, 2003)
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
          To me, this reads as people using the hypertext are more concerned with
          prior authority than if they were reading conventional writing. Mostly
          because it does not dispel the vibe of the original intent. It is easier
          to streamline the main ideas of a rabbithole, but it also gives way to
          an easier spread of misinformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is said at least twice in the reading that hypertext does not replace
          books, but television as we still print lots and lots of books in
          today's time. However, that is not to say that books will remain as
          forests dwindle, paper costs rise, and maintenance for libraires will
          become too much. Though us book lovers need not fear as 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The chief
          technological culprit in Kernan’s “death of literature” is not the smart
          machine but the idiot box." (Moulthrop, 2003)
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
          Hypertext does return two
          domains, namely literature and writing space. I interpret this return of
          domains as websites like fanfiction.com and AO3 where people have spaces
          on the internet to write their literature and share that literature with
          others for free. When taken to its extreme, hypertext becomes
          paradoxical like I have previously mentioned.

          I really like the aesthetic of a retro funky vibe. Most of the
          wireframes look like this one, but I will include them in case anyone is
          interested.

          Then, for mobile, I wanted to keep the squiggly lines and colour scheme:

          One of the colour schemes I thought to use because I like the

        </p>
        <p>
          I like the squiggles because they're fun and I feel like it represents
          my mind and its constant state of thinking several things at once.
