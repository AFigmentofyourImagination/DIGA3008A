        When reading Moulthrop (2003), it starts as listing the good things that
        hypertext can do for people navigating the internet. It tells a quick
        history linking back to the origin of the hypertext with Vannevar Bush
        and the Memex in the 1940's, artificial intelligence researchers in the
        1960's created the first hypertextual narrative to experiment with
        interactive computing. Nelson then coined the term hypertext in the
        1970's and had big ideas for it, which later on caused Engelbart to
        partner with him to create a hypertext system called FRESS. It didn't
        catch on until 1987, when Microsoft Press published Nelson's underground
        works. Later, in the 90's, the hype around hypertext had died down for
        the next big thing and Moulthrop (2003) states that "such changes of
        fashion seem a regular hazard of the postmodern territory." He says that
        people are waiting for a technological revolution, but that we do not
        know what we are actually asking for, and are thus constantly
        disappointed and move in circles.
        <br />
        After hypertext comes hyperreality. When this essay was published,
        virtual reality was merely living on the internet, but now in today's
        age, there are VR headsets that allows you to move more into a
        hyper*reality*. Moulthrop (2003) explains it best, "Hyperreality, we are
        told, is a site of collapse or implosion where referential or “grounded”
        utterance becomes indistinguishable from the self-referential and the
        imaginary." Later on, he states that we are at risk of falling into a
        hopelessly abandoned simulation. Other academics, that Moulthrop has
        used, have all said that postmodern modes of communication are capable
        and will destabilize the current social hierarchy. We have already seen
        that happen, the best example I can think of is in school where the more
        followers you have on your socials indicate how popular you are in the
        social hierarchy of school. Everyone directs people to follow them on
        their other social media platforms via the hypertext in their bio. This
        reconstruction of the social hierarchy is what Nelson referred to as
        populitism - the combination of "populism” and “elite. The popular elite
        will shift the attention to accommodate the demands of the moment, and
        this is where the politics comes to stir the pot.
        <br />
        We have even seen how it could happen this year already when the US
        government tried to ban TikTok, and the orange in charge 'played the
        hero' when he was all for banning the platform just a few years ago, and
        this all caused havoc on the platform for like 2 weeks (I'm not on
        TikTok a lot, so I don't know how long people milked it). "Hypertext
        does increase the agonistic element in reading." (Moulthrop, 2003) To
        me, this reads as people using the hypertext are more concerned with
        prior authority than if they were reading conventional writing. Mostly
        because it does not dispel the vibe of the original intent. It is easier
        to streamline the main ideas of a rabbithole, but it also gives way to
        an easier spread of misinformation.
        <br />
        It is said at least twice in the reading that hypertext does not replace
        books, but television as we still print lots and lots of books in
        today's time. However, that is not to say that books will remain as
        forests dwindle, paper costs rise, and maintenance for libraires will
        become too much. Though us book lovers need not fear as "The chief
        technological culprit in Kernan’s “death of literature” is not the smart
        machine but the idiot box." (Moulthrop, 2003) Hypertext does return two
        domains, namely literature and writing space. I interpret this return of
        domains as websites like fanfiction.com and AO3 where people have spaces
        on the internet to write their literature and share that literature with
        others for free. When taken to its extreme, hypertext becomes
        paradoxical like I have previously mentioned.
        <br />

        Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’.

        Wireframe ideas:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Desktop-Homepage.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the homepage. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to the other sections of my webpage."
        />
        I really like the aesthetic of a retro funky vibe. Most of the
        wireframes look like this one, but I will include them in case anyone is
        interested.
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Desktop-Blog.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the blog page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to my individual blog posts."
        />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Desktop-Design.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the design page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to my linked process."
        />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Desktop-Essays.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the essay page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to my individual essays."
        />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Desktop-Portfolio.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the portfolio page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to small sections of my art."
        />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Desktop-Profile.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the profile page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with a light green information card."
        />
        <br />
        Then, for mobile, I wanted to keep the squiggly lines and colour scheme:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Mobile-Homepage.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the homepage. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to the other sections of my webpage."
        />

        />
        <img

          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the design page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to my linked process."
        />
        <img
          src="../Images/Wireframes/Wireframe-Mobile-Essays.jpg"
          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the essay page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to my individual essays."
        />
        <img

          alt="An image showing my first wireframe idea for the portfolio page. It has swoopy yellow and pink lines on a blue background with light green hyperlinks. The hyperlinks lead to small sections of my art."
        />
        <img

          alt="A colour scheme card with it's hex codes."
        />
        <br />One of the colour schemes I thought to use because I like the

        <br />A pattern I found fun to use. Link:

        MORE FUN SQUIGGLES. Link:

        <br />
        I like the squiggles because they're fun and I feel like it represents
        my mind and its constant state of thinking several things at once.
