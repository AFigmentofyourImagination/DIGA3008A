          The reading I chose to do a close reading on is Ballatore et al's
          Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results (2017). I
          will format this post by showing the quote, analysing it, and then
          giving more information on it as that is what makes sense to me on how
          to present this analysis in a functional way.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The digital augmentations of places, in other words, are beginning to
          matter as much as their material counter-parts, and much research has
          shown how they can have significant impacts on how we economically,
          socially, and politically interact with our environments (see Kitchin
          and Dodge 2011; Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook 2015). Digital code and
          content thus do not just reflect the world but also produce it."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This quote means that physical landmarks and buildings are becoming
          immortalised in the digital world, and just like one would maintain a
          physical building, their digital equivalent needs to keep up to date
          with the new version. Ballatore et. al states that there was research
          done by Kitchin and Dodge 2011; Graham, De Sabbata, and Zook 2015, and
          there are 3 different ways it impacts interaction, those being
          economically, socially and politically. The digital world does not
          just reflect the physical entity and its reputation, but it also
          produces another entity that is in collaboration with the physical.
          The digital world is making the physical have an online presence to
          attract more people because the people who can afford to go visit
          other places can also afford an internet connection. Additional
          research from Lama (2024) states that there are multiple reasons for
          businesses to engage in having an online presence, from both a
          tourist's and business's perspectives. There are overlapping reasons
          such as, destination discovering, real time information, Virtual
          tourism/exploration, interaction with influencers, and booking
          reservations.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Because the Web has long been envisaged as a participatory tool, and
          because its usership now approaches 3.5 billion people (almost half of
          the world’s population), many have hoped that the construction of
          information geographies could become more open, participatory, and
          democratic."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I use this quote to show how far we have come since 2017. According to
          Petrosyan (2024), the number of internet users have increased and sits
          now at 5.56 billion people. That is two thirds of the world population
          at the time of the latest statistics. This means that the internet has
          grown to include more users in participating, something Ballatore had
          hoped.

        <blockquote>
          "Elwood (2006) noted that little has changed for those at the bottom
          of the digital divide, and financial and skill barriers continue to
          influence who gets a say in digital representations of the world and
          who does not (see also Craig and Elwood 1998)."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Those who cannot afford to access the internet and those who do not
          have the skills to navigate the internet has less accurate
          representation. This is because the people who represent them do not
          necessarily know what they need. Oftentimes it is because they need
          other necessities more than the internet, like housing and proper
          water. This is a failure on the government's part, so I will not be
          going into that too much because it is a whole other essay topic.

        <blockquote>
          "Most people use a digital search as their gateway not just to a
          disembodied Web but also to their lived everyday geographies: using it
          to learn about a destination, shop, navigate, and perform countless
          other activities."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Things of the internet that has replaced others are GPS, online
          shopping, scheduling appointments or booking a reservation, streaming
          services, online banking, and email.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "A user has a requirement for information, and the available set of
          published information is much larger than the user has utility for.
          Search engines thus do not just direct a user to relevant information
          but filter that information to distinguish between more and less
          useful content."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          There is a lot of knowledge online and it is overwhelming to search
          through them all to search for the user's specific thing. The top
          results when you do an online search is the information people have
          found most relevant when typing in a similar query, or at least has
          the most clicks. Google (2025) actually explains their system in the
          following list:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "To return relevant results, we first need to establish what you’re
          looking for - the intent behind your query. Next, our systems analyze
          the content to assess whether it contains information that might be
          relevant to what you are looking for. We also use aggregated and
          anonymized interaction data to assess whether search results are
          relevant to queries. After identifying relevant content, our systems
          aim to prioritize those that seem most helpful. To do this, they
          identify signals that can help determine which content demonstrates
          expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. Our systems also
          consider the usability of content. When all other signals are
          relatively equal, content that people will find more accessible may
          perform better. Search aims to connect human curiosity to knowledge as
          accurately as possible. To do this, we use information such as your
          location, past Search history, and Search settings to determine what
          is most relevant for you in the moment. Our systems can recognize if
          you have visited the same page multiple times before and bring that
          page to the top of your Search results. Or, if you are using the same
          query, we may show new perspectives and top stories from across the
          web."

          "We computed the indicator L for the 144 countries. Because each case
          includes a Google query at four different times, the localness for a
          country is expressed as mean L of the four temporal snapshots and the
          corresponding standard deviation (SD). As shown in Figure 5, the value
          of L varies widely across the data set. Figure 5 compares the
          distribution of L in U.S. Google (median D 0.22) with local Google
          results (median D 0.37). The gap between the distributions reflects
          the expected fact that results for U.S. Google in English are less
          local than the localized versions of Google in different languages.
          The distribution of local Google is particularly wide, ranging from 0
          to 1 without large gaps, indicating that cases exist for every level
          of localness."

          L means localness. Basically what this means is that the researchers
          have compared the distribution of localness in U.S. Google with local
          Google results. It is shown that search results in U.S. Google in
          English are less local than other places using a localized version of
          Google in different languages. Below is an image of the results:

          "Whereas some countries receive results from a few dominant countries,
          others receive results from a broader range of sources. To quantify
          diversity at the country level, we draw an ecological analogy
          comparing species diversity in an ecosystem with the diversity of
          countries of origin in the URLs. Hence, we compute a widely used
          indicator of diversity based on Shannon entropy (Levine and
          HilleRisLambers 2009) on the URLs, obtaining an index ranging between
          0 (low diversity) and 2 (high diversity)."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          So, while places get results from any dominant countries, it is a
          disadvantage to those living in the dominant countries as they do not
          get the diversity of other places, whereas those not living in the
          dominant countries get a lot more than their small local range of
          resources.

          "Although the full ten-variable model explains a substantial amount of
          the variation in L, the collinearities highlighted in Table 5 make the
          model difficult to interpret. To provide a more interpretable model
          M1, we identified four variables using forward selection that explain
          53 percent of the total variance: h-index, region (a categorical
          variable with seven World Bank regions), the percentage of Internet
          users, and a Boolean factor indicating whether or not English is

          "To summarize, we find that geographic region, strength of scholarly
          publishing, Internet infrastructure, and language barriers all play
          important roles in shaping the geography of Google Search results.
          These four variables explain roughly half of the variation in L,
          leaving much room to evaluate the role of other country-specific
          attributes. We note that these explanatory variables do exhibit
          significant collinearities, making it difficult to neatly unpack the
          roles of individual factors. We also find significant differences
          between the explanatory models for the U.S. and local results;
          countries not in North America exhibit much higher L values in local

          poorly connected countries. Even cities located in countries with huge
          populations such as Lagos show a tendency toward having relatively
          little local content about them in Google Search results. This means
          that a user in the United States or Germany searching for cities is
          far more likely to be given access to locally produced content than a
          Tanzanian or Cambodian."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Because of the lack of resources to produce content in the local
          context, the poor and poorly connected countries are reliant on the
          information coming from the dominant countries, so they do not really
          have anything relating to them, whereas the wealthy and well-connected
          countries have more relevant information available. Population in this
          case does not mean the same as accessible to the internet. The next
          quote is an extension of my observation:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The United States, in particular, is a dominant content-producing
          force, even when excluding Wikipedia, which is a highly visible
          U.S.-based but globally assembled resource (Figures 10 and 11). In the
          results for sixty-one countries, the United States supplies over half
          of the first page content on Google. This means that not only are U.S.
          Internet users surrounded by an extremely locally produced Internet,
          but U.S.-produced content is highly visible in much of the rest of the
          world. This does not necessarily mean that the United States is an
          informational hegemon everywhere in the world, however. France has a
          somewhat smaller sphere of influence, mainly limited to countries in
          Africa, whereas Russia produces a visible effect only on results about
          Kyrgyzstan (see Figure 10)."

          The reading does say that they have mainly focused on capital cities
          and that their localness indicator did not take into account what
          search results people actually interact with and the multitude of the
          devices / media across the search engines. They state that they are
          not without vault and some noise might have been able to slip in
          undetected because it is difficult to keep track of that. Simply put,
          the conclusion reads that the Global North have the current monopoly
          on the distribution of content online because they are simply more
          advanced in the field than the Global South.
