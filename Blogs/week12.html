          In my own code, I know I should be aware of assuming things, like
          Internet literacy and simplicity. I know that JavaScript does cause
          the server to take longer to load all the cool things I want to
          implement and so I need to remember to keep things short and sweet and
          simple with my coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have added a back to top button on everything to JavaScript so it
          only appears when a certain percentage is scrolled down. I have been
          said by a few people that it would make the navigation of things
          easier. I am working on getting the navigation menu to be collapsable
          (hamburger menu), but this is for some silly reason my boulder, and I
          am Sisyphus. I want this to work because I know it will just make
          things look cleaner and also more functional. I also have to revisit
          ALL my previous coding pages to implement the JavaScript and change
          some things around, which is extremely tedious, but it needs to be
          done. I am also working on making a few images to appear when you load
          in a certain pages. This is mainly to fill in some empty spaces that I
          have been made aware of. I am also working on making more things for
          my portfolio, but I might redesign my portfolio page, because I don't
          have the time to add everything I wanted to.
