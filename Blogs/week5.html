    <h1>Catch Up</h1>
    <article>
      <p>
        Goal Alignment: A place where all my work is in one place, for me to be
        organized, for users to easily navigate through my art and form their
        opinion on me based on what I put out onto the internet.
        <br />
        Information Structure: Folder Structure is for each page, and for the
        internal storage for the website.
        <br />
        User Flow:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/user-flow.jpg"
          alt="A mind map of how the screens will look in a user flow."
        />
        <br />
        Navigation bar will be a permanent feature on all pages, even the in
        depth ones. All images in the portfolio will be clickable to enlarge it.
        On the in depth pages will be a back button to return to the main
        section page. The buttons will be responsive to the mouse, thus they
        will swell when hovered over and darken when clicked. If you're already
        on the page, the button will lighten to indicate you're already there. I
        don't know what use I'll have for icons since everything is labelled
        (other than for the footer), but maybe I could put the icons next to the
        labels in case there's a language barrier. The style will then
        definitely be a black outline for them so they stand out against the
        colourful everything else. I like the fonts Bradley Hand ITC for
        headings and Baskerville for the body. They feel like they fit with the
        retro-ish aesthetic I'm going for.
        <br />
        The colours I chose:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/colour-palette.jpg"
          alt="An image showing all the colours in the colour palette with their names, hexcodes, CMYK, and RGB."
        />
        <br />
        Buttons will be rectangles with rounded edges. Wireframes was in week 2,
        but I'll link them <a href="../Design/wireframes.html">here</a>
        I did make a flow chart for interactions a few weeks ago:
        <br />
        <img
          src="../Images/flowchart.jpg"
          alt="A flowchart indicating how the website will flow."
        />
      </p>
    </article>
    <footer>
      Link to Instagram. Email. GitHub. (I'll get to linking those at a later
      time)
